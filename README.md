# Abstract

Maintaining a healthy diet requires consistent effort, and one of the biggest challenges people face is accurately tracking their daily calorie intake. Staying on top of nutritional goals can be overwhelming with busy schedules, varied food choices, and hidden calories in many foods. Our Calorie Tracker simplifies this process by providing an intuitive, user-friendly platform that helps individuals monitor their food consumption, set personalized goals, and make informed dietary decisions. By offering a comprehensive database of foods, easy logging features, and insightful analytics, our tool empowers users to take control of their nutrition without the hassle of manual calculations. Whether for weight loss, muscle gain, or general wellness, Calorie Tracker makes calorie tracking effortless and effective.

# Our Project

Our project is a macronutrient (fats, protein, carbohydrates) and calorie calculator. The logic is written in Python, while user interface design is done in HTML and connected using the FLASK microweb framework. The calorie calculator portion of our project first calculates a user's basal metabolic rate (the amount of calories needed for the body to function while stagnant) and calculates maintenance calories using that BMR. Next, the application uses a user's maintenance calories to calculate calorie deficits (weight loss) or surplus amounts (weight/muscle gain). This is shown in a sleek very easy-to-understand way using HTML and CSS scripts. It allows you to only focus on the calories, protein, and other nutrients you might need in the day. This allows you to only focus on your goals, and nothing else!

# Tasks and Ticket System (Jira)

In order to keep track of features, designs, and the actual web app, we used the project management application Jira. This kept us on track for the various different features functions and designs that we had to do. It allowed us to focus on what needed to get done while keeping it simple. Overall, this helped streamline our workflow.
