# Introduction

Fitness is something that is important for everyone's lives and health, and this project provides individuals with a starting point. Our project is a simple Macronutrient and Calorie calculator with backend logic developed in Python. This allows for users to see the amount of calories and each macronutrient which they should be consuming each day, providing them with an easy starting point in their fitness journey.

The logic of our project begins by taking a user's height, weight, activity level (sedentary, moderate, active), gender.
From there, it moves into calculating a user's basal metabolic rate (BMR):
- Uses Harris-Benedict Formula 
- Basal Metabolic Rate: Amount of energy (calories) a persons body needs to function while at rest.
Next, it uses the users BMR to calculate maintenance calories, calorie deficit, and calorie surplus. It then uses a user's maintenance calories to calculate macronutrients (fats, protein, carbohydrates). 

# Anticipated Technologies

Python, CSS, HTML

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)
1. Solidify logic, unit testing
2. Plan out UI/UX
3. Execute UI Production and formatting
4. Test UX/UI design functionality

# Estimated Timeline

Backend logic is essentially done, whereas UI/UX development has not been started. Hoping to get a start in the next couple weeks,and have details ironed out by spring break.

# Anticipated Problems

General problems which could arise from unfamiliarity of CSS or HTML.
